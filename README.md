# msca-31009-final
Final project for my MSCA 31009 ON01 Machine Learning &amp; Predictive Analytics course.

Utilizes the [CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images) by DR JORDAN J. BIRD on Kaggle. The goal of this project is to be able to identify whether an image is ai generated or not.
